# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at IIIT Vadodara with a passion for web development and a thirst for exploring different domains. My background includes projects in Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Web Development, and I'm always eager to learn new things.

This repository is my digital playground, where I experiment and build projects that spark my interest. I strive to create beautiful and efficient web experiences with a focus on functionality.

Feel free to browse around and see what I'm working on!
